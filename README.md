This repository contains all the data, code and materials required to reproduce the analyses presented in [the above article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4755823). Other associated materials can be found in the OSF project [here](https://osf.io/635dv/). This repository is linked in the project.

This repository is a Quarto project endowed with a `renv` R environment to ensure the stability of the packages that were used to conduct the analysis and guarantee the reproducibility of the results. The repository is based on [this Quarto project template](https://github.com/m-delem/my-quarto-template): you can find a quick tutorial to use this project structure and an in-depth explanation of its elements in the README of the template.

The main rendered notebooks can be found in the `_outputs/notebooks/` folder.

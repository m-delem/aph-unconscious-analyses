# Are there unconscious mental images in aphantasia? Development of a new priming paradigm.

This Quarto project contains all the data and code required to replicate the analyses presented in the above article. I sincerely apologize, the research schedule of a PhD student being what it is, I don't have time to write a thorough README for this project, even though I'd love to. However, the folder structure here is based on [my personal Quarto research template, which you can find on GitHub](https://github.com/m-delem/my-quarto-template). It has a pretty detailed README on the data analysis workflow underlying this project (and my personal recommendations). I'll just write the first step (assuming you have the necessary software): start by opening `open-this-file-first.RProj` with RStudio and read/run what's in the `scripts/_setup.R` script.

All the scripts and notebooks are also thoroughly commented, so that might help. Lastly, if you came all the way down here to read this for instructions with the intention of using this project, well (1) I'm very grateful, because I didn't expect that to ever happen, and (2) I'd be more than happy to give you pointers and/or chat about this analysis. Contact me at <mael.delem@univ-lyon2.fr> or <mael.a.delem@gmail.com> if you need anything.

Cheers,
MaÃ«l Delem
